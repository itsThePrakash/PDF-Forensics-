# 🕵️ PDF Forgery Detection using Multi-Modal Forensics + ML

### B.Tech CSE Major Project

This project implements a production-grade PDF forensic analysis system that detects document tampering using:

- Multi-modal forensic analysis
- Machine Learning (Random Forest + XGBoost Ensemble)
- Domain-based explainability (NO SHAP)
- Backend PDF report generation

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

PDF tampering can occur across multiple layers:

- Structural (PDF internals)
- Textual (OCR, fonts, layout)
- Image (compression artifacts, edits)
- Metadata (timestamps, inconsistencies)

Traditional tools fail to detect cross-layer inconsistencies.

This project builds a multi-modal forensic pipeline + ML system to detect such tampering and generate interpretable reports.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect structural anomalies in PDFs
- Identify textual inconsistencies using OCR
- Detect image tampering using forensic signals (no CNN)
- Build strong engineered features
- Train ML models (Random Forest + XGBoost)
- Use ensemble with threshold tuning
- Provide clear forensic explanations (domain-based)
- Generate professional PDF reports

## 🧩 Modules

### 🔹 Structural Analysis

Detects:

- Multiple startxref
- Stream length mismatches
- Metadata inconsistencies
- Time gap anomalies

Strongest tampering signal.

---

### 🔹 Textual Analysis

- OCR using Tesseract
- Font and layout extraction

Detects:

- OCR mismatch
- Font anomalies
- Text overlap
- Layout inconsistencies

---

### 🔹 Image Forensics (No CNN)

File: forensic_image_detector.py

Replaced CNN with deterministic signals:

1. Noise Residual Analysis
2. JPEG Artifact Detection
3. Edge Inconsistency Detection

Final score:

score = 0.4 _ noise + 0.3 _ jpeg + 0.3 \* edge

Fully explainable and lightweight.

---

### 🔹 Feature Builder (Core)

File: feature_builder.py

Combines all signals into ML-ready features.

Key features:

- num_startxref
- time_gap_seconds
- stream_length_mismatch_count
- ocr_noise_weighted
- image_score_signature

---

### 🔹 Machine Learning

Models:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Ensemble

Dataset:

```
dataset/
├── genuine/
├── tampered/
├── labels.csv
```

- Size: 296 samples
- Features: 34

## 🔥 Model Performance

| Model         | Accuracy | AUC    |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Random Forest | 88.33%   | 0.9417 |
| XGBoost       | 85.00%   | 0.9294 |
| Ensemble      | 93.33%   | 0.9439 |

---

## ⚙️ Ensemble Configuration

- XGBoost weight: 0.2
- Threshold: 0.4

---

## 🧠 Prediction Logic

Combined probability:
combined*prob = (0.2 * XGB) + (0.8 \_ RF)

Confidence:
confidence = abs(prob - threshold) / max(threshold, 1 - threshold)

Disagreement:
abs(RF - XGB)

---

## 🔍 Explainability (Domain-Based)

Example explanations:

- Multiple startxref sections detected
- Metadata inconsistency detected
- High OCR error rate
- Image compression anomaly

---

## 🧬 Tampering Types

- Text Tampering
- Image Tampering
- Metadata Tampering
- Structural Tampering

Each has a confidence score.
